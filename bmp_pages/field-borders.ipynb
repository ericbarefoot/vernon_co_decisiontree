    "How it works: When water is running across a field, it carries soil particles. If you put buffer strips  around the edges of your field, it puts a permanent barrier perpendicular to the waterâ€™s path. This makes the water slow down, and drop its soil particles in the buffer strip. This intervention is conceptually similar to a filter strip, but is planted and maintained around the edge of a field, rather than at the end of furrow plantings  or along contours.\n",
