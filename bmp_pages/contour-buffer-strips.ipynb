    "How it works: When water is running across a field, it carries soil particles. If you put buffer strips between production strips along the contour in your field, it puts a permanent barrier perpendicular to the waterâ€™s path. This makes the water slow down, and drop its soil particles in the buffer strip. This intervention is conceptually similar to a filter strip, but is planted and maintained along a contour, rather than at the end of furrow plantings.\n",
