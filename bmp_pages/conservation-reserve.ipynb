    "How it works:  Sometimes, your surrounding environment needs the land to recover for some time before it can go back into production. One way to protect water resources, limit floods, and protect and develop new soils is to establish and maintain perennial vegetation cover on retired land.  This allows the land to recover and puts new nutrients and carbon into the soil.\n",
