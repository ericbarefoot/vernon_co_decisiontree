    "How it works: When water is running across a field, it carries soil particles. If you plant and maintain permanent vegetation at the downstream edges of your field, it puts a permanent barrier in the waterâ€™s path. This makes the water slow down and drop its soil particles in the filter strip. This intervention is conceptually similar to a buffer strip, but it is planted and maintained specifically at the end of furrow plantings or at the downstream end of a field. The strategy is intended to catch the particles before they enter waterways,  for they can pollute waterways and also add additional water , increasing flood intensity.\n",
