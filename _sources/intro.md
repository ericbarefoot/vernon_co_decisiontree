# A guide to rural best management practices in Vernon County

The purpose of this guide is to list out some good ideas to common challenges in our Hill and Valley (Driftless, Coulee, Seven Rivers) area. This book is an effort to take the dense and unreadable NRCS documents and provide a reource of the main ideas in practical terms. 

This is not a how-to guide that you can take and implement with step-by-step instructions. Some of these practices and strategies really need to involve your local NRCS and/or Land & Water staff. For many of these, you could hire a private consultant or other professional. Some of these options might cost too much for the benefit. You will have to make that decision for yourself. 

However, your local Land and Water staff want to help you make the right choice. Please consider involving them in your land management, because they can help you find federal, or state money to support changes and upgrades to your farming that you already wanted to do. They can also help you choose between and give you a lot of information about all the different options you could choose. 

We'll talk a little bit about cost. Not in dollars and cents, but we'll point out which practices are more expensive, which ones are less expensive. It's up to you to know whether you can afford something, and we'll point out where common practices have less expensive alternatives. 

With that in mind, this guidebook is going to be a broad overview. It will not get into the nitty-gritty. It will be direct, blunt, and simplified to be as clear as possible. We will offer assessments and a pro/con list for each practice. 

If you think something could be more clear, or you want more details, reach out to _your_ land and water staff so that they can clarify it for you. We will also link to the relevant NRCS so that you can learn more on your own.

## How to use this guide

This guide will work like a "decision tree." That means that we will start with the big decisions you need to make about your property, and as you keep answering questions, it will end in a list of potential management practices to suit your issue. You can also look at the table of contents, and go directly to a practice, if it is something you want to learn about. 

Additionally, there is a search function at the top-right of the screen that you can use to look for keywords to find the information you need.
