    "How it works:  Instead of simply harvesting and leaving the soil bare over the winter, you can plant a cover crop that prevents soil erosion, injects nitrogen back into the soil, and protects the soil until the next planting.  This has the side benefit of increasing water infiltration, because cover crops slow down water, and direct it to their roots. During springtime rains, this could be very beneficial to dampening flood peaks.\n",
