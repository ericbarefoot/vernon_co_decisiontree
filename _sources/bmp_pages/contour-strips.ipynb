    "How it works: When water runs downhill it flows along the steepest path. As water keeps flowing along the steepest path on the slope, it picks up sediment, soil, and fertilizer.  You can prevent erosion in your field, and reduce the intensity of floods, by slowing that water down. Contour strip cropping puts alternating barriers perpendicular to the flowing water, so that the water has to slow down. The water can’t build up momentum because there’s always something different in its way.\n",
